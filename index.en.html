  <h1>Master Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)</h1>
  <h2>Step-by-step methods, examples, and resources to support better decision making in business and information systems.</h2>
  <p>
    Decision Lab provides structured learning materials for multi-criteria decision making,
    from introductory concepts to practical applications using methods such as AHP, TOPSIS, and SAW.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to apply decision support and
    analytical techniques in real-world decision problems.

<!-- Methods -->
<section id="methods">
  <h2>MCDM Methods</h2>
  <p>
    Start with a method that matches your familiarity and the complexity of your decision problem.
    Each method will be documented with overview, steps, numerical examples, and implementation notes.
  </p>
  <div class="methods-grid">
    <article class="card">
      <span class="badge">Recommended start</span>
      <h3>Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)</h3>
      <p>
        Hierarchical, pairwise comparison-based method to derive criteria weights and rank alternatives
        with consistency checks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suitable for strategic decisions with qualitative and quantitative criteria.</li>
        <li>Uses pairwise comparisons and consistency ratio.</li>
        <li>Commonly used in project selection, vendor evaluation, and prioritization.</li>
      </ul>

    <article class="card">
      <span class="badge">Ranking focus</span>
      <h3>TOPSIS</h3>
      <p>
        Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, ranking alternatives based on
        distance to ideal and anti-ideal solutions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Effective for ranking alternatives with measurable performance scores.</li>
        <li>Uses normalization, weighting, and distance to ideal solutions.</li>
        <li>Popular in supplier selection, location selection, and performance evaluation.</li>
      </ul>

    <article class="card">
      <span class="badge">Beginner friendly</span>
      <h3>Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)</h3>
      <p>
        Weighted sum method that evaluates and ranks alternatives using normalized scores and
        predefined weights.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Good entry point for those new to MCDM.</li>
        <li>Conceptually simple and easy to implement in Excel.</li>
        <li>Useful for many everyday multi-criteria decisions.</li>
      </ul>

<!-- About the Lab -->
<section id="about-lab">
  <h2>About Decision Lab</h2>
  <p>
    Decision Lab is created and maintained by
    <a href="https://dsihombing.github.io/">Denny JC Sihombing</a>, lecturer in the Information Systems
    Study Program at Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia.
  </p>
  <p>
