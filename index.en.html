  <h1>Master Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)</h1>
  <h2>Systematic guides to methods, examples, and resources for better decision-making in business and information systems</h2>
  <p>
    Decision Lab provides structured learning materials for multi-criteria decision making, 
    from foundational concepts to practical applications using methods such as AHP, TOPSIS, and SAW.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to apply decision support 
    and analytical techniques to solve real-world decision problems.

<section id="methods">
  <h2>MCDM Methods</h2>
  <p>
    Start with a method that matches your familiarity and the complexity of your decision problem. 
    Each method will be documented with overviews, step-by-step procedures, numerical examples, and implementation notes.
  </p>

      <span class="badge">Recommended Start</span>
      <h3>Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)</h3>
      <p>
        Hierarchical, pairwise comparison-based method to derive criteria weights and rank alternatives with consistency checks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suitable for strategic decisions with qualitative and quantitative criteria</li>
        <li>Uses pairwise comparisons and consistency ratio validation</li>
        <li>Commonly used in project selection, vendor evaluation, and prioritization</li>
      </ul>

      <span class="badge">Ranking Focus</span>
      <h3>TOPSIS</h3>
      <p>
        Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, ranking alternatives based on distance to ideal and anti-ideal solutions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Effective for ranking alternatives with measurable performance scores</li>
        <li>Uses normalization, weighting, and distance to ideal solutions</li>
        <li>Popular in supplier selection, location choice, and performance evaluation</li>
      </ul>

      <span class="badge">Beginner Friendly</span>
      <h3>Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)</h3>
      <p>
        Weighted sum method that evaluates and ranks alternatives using normalized scores and predefined weights.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Good entry point for those new to MCDM</li>
        <li>Conceptually simple and easy to implement in spreadsheets</li>
        <li>Useful for everyday multi-criteria decisions</li>
      </ul>
